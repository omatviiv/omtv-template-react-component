Component is not bundled or compiled, It is provided in raw form as is
(see `component/` folder).
The project that is going to use this component should bundle and
complie component itself, here are the instructions for webpack and babel:
```webpack.config.js
module.exports = {
  ...
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.js$/,
        include: [
          path.resolve(__dirname, 'src'),
          path.resolve(__dirname, 'node_modules/my-component'),
        ],
        use: {
          loader: 'babel-loader',
          options: {
            ...
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  },
  ...
};
```
You can also use [omtv-template-react](https://github.com/omatviiv/omtv-template-react)
for your project, it's webpack/babel config is compatible with this approach.

# Static type checking
Component contains [Flow Comment Types](https://flow.org/en/docs/types/comments/)
that allows either to use flow static typechecking or simply ignore it.

# Improve
1. Install dependencies `npm i`.
2. Start webpack dev server for demo project `npm run demo`.
3. (optional) Start jest in watch mode `npm run jest`.
4. Improve component.
5. (optional) Publish component demo:
  `npm run publish-demo` will try to publish demo
  create scripts/secret.js file
  ```
    module.exports = {
      pwd: '', // leave this field empty if you want script to prompt for password
      host: 'your.host.com', // default port 22, specify other port: 'your.host:222'
    };
  ```
  Scripts/secret.js is added to gitignore.
